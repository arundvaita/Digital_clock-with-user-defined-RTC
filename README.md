# Digital_clock-with-user-defined-RTC
User defined RTC, LCD driver 

This repository contains embedded c code for a digital clock without using RTC. The code for RTC is defined here. So it will update time and date automatically even for Leap years. And this is code designed in such a it duplicate a digital watch. So it have Alarm, Stopwatch, Timer and it also include wishes for special days. We can set/reset these things without affecting the time. this repositary contains Proteus simulation file too. eventhough this code is written for 8051 controller, we can use the concept for any controllers, just need to edit the register names.
